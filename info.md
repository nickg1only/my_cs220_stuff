# CMPSCI 220 Programming Methodology

This git repository has been created for you to use during your time
in CMPSCI 220. At the conclusion of the semester it will be deleted on
the gitblit git hosting site. You can keep your work, however, you
will no longer be able to push to gitblit. Publishing your git
repository to a public hosting service such as github is considered
academic dishonesty. Publishing your work anywhere on the web or
sharing it with other students currently in the course or taking the
course in any future semester is also considered academic dishonesty.
