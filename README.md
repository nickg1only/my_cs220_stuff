#My Readme File

I am a Computer Science major on the pre-med track.

I have coded in Java, C++, C, Python, Bash (Linux script), 
R (statistical language), and Matlab, and I have had some experience 
using Javascript (used it to create an interactive Christmas card), 
HTML, and JMP. I feel that my coding capabilities in Java, C, and C++ 
are very very strong. I have been coding in Java and C++ for more than 
three years; I made programs in C++ in high school, and I coded in 
Java extensively (wrote several programs) throughout my freshman year 
and a little in my sophomore year. As a sophomore, I had to write 
several programs in C for one of my classes. For the same class, I had to 
learn how to do basic Bash scripting. I learned Python in middle school, 
but though I have not really used it since then I can pick it up again 
quickly if need be.
